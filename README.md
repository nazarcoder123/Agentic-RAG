# Agentic-RAG
Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an advanced version of traditional RAG where autonomous agents handle different tasks in the retrieval and generation pipeline. Instead of a single-step retrieval and generation process, Agentic RAG breaks it down into multiple intelligent, goal-driven steps managed by agents.
